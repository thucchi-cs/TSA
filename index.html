                <p class="para">
                    As of right now, fossil fuels are the main source of conventional (non-green) energy. That includes things like gas, oil, coal, etc. However, the combustion of fossil fuels to make energy is not at all sustainable for the future. Not only are these resources limited, this process releases so much greenhouse gasses that it pollutes our environment. Luckily, we do have a solution, green energy! Green and clean energy is the production of energy that uses renewable resources and has a low-impact on the environment. Renewable resources are the ones that can restore themselves over short periods of time, such as solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, and biogas. These green energies are both sustainable and do not harm our lives or wildlife. So choosing your energy sources wisely can impact the Earth greatly. Green energy is the future of a healthy planet.

                <h2 class="topics">The Importance of Green Energy</h2>
                <p class="para">
                    As stated, green energy will benefit both us humans and the environment. Green technologies reduce air and water pollution. Also, unlike conventional energy, green energy will last so much longer because it is renewable. And because it's renewable, we won't be wasting the Earth's resources.
