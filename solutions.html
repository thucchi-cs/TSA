                    The solar water heaters system uses sunlight to heat water in your home. The system requires storage tanks and solar collectors. This is a really effective system because it replaces 50% of the hot water that is created by traditional water heaters. However, itâ€™s best to still have a backup system for days where there is not much sunshine.

                <h2 class="topics">Solar Energy</h2>
                <p class="para">
                    Unlike the solar water heater, the solar energy system produces electricity that is used to power your overall house or structure. Solar panels would be installed on top of your house or around it to absorb energy. This energy is then converted into power and electricity. The panels are very reliable and are designed to survive storms and hail. This system is durable and powerful, it can power the whole home if needed. But there is a downside, it does not usually integrate into an existing system very well. But it is still a great option for efficient and clean energy.

                    If your house is next to a body of water, the geothermal heat pumps are perfect for you. There are many different systems for your preference. The Pond system lays pipes in the body of water near you to absorb energy there. The Open-Loop system uses the heat exchange with the earth's surface to create energy. There are a lot more other systems, or you can even choose a hybrid. Even though this system is more costly than some other options, it has all kinds of benefits. It is long lasting, durable, and consistent year round.
